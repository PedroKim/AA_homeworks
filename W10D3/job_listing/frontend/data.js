We have offices in NYC and Denver, but more than 50% of the team is remote, in exotic locations like the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Ohio.\r\n\r\nBecause we're distributed and because most of our tasks aren't immediately time-sensitive we don't really have operating hours, per se.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.\r\n\r\nRight now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.\r\n\r\nTo attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.\r\n\r\n8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School\r\n\r\n1 - Solve Interesting Problems\r\n\r\nMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.\r\n\r\nThis includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.\r\n\r\nWe have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.\r\n\r\nThe point is, you’ll never be bored working here.\r\n\r\n2 - Work With A Clean Codebase\r\n\r\nTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”\r\n\r\nWe don’t work like that.\r\n\r\nWe spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.\r\n\r\nThis long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.\r\n\r\n3 - Endless Opportunities To Grow\r\n\r\nYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.\r\n\r\nWe get how important growth is for developers.\r\n\r\nWant to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.\r\n\r\nWant to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.\r\n\r\n4 - Get Expert Guidance\r\n\r\nOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.\r\n\r\nIf there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.\r\n\r\nBesides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.\r\n\r\nJoin our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.\r\n\r\n5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own Time\r\n\r\nHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?\r\n\r\nYou abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.\r\n\r\nWe do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.\r\n\r\nThis means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.\r\n\r\n6 - Work From Anywhere In The World\r\n\r\nWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!\r\n\r\nIf the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.\r\n\r\n7 - Stability You Can Count On\r\n\r\nMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.\r\n\r\nRather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to worry about the company running out of money.\r\n\r\n8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your Code\r\n\r\nHelping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.\r\n\r\nDuring the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.\r\n\r\nYour work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.\r\n\r\nHere’s What We Expect From You…\r\n- You’re excellent at PHP \r\n- You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP \r\n- You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years \r\n- You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems \r\n- You want to participate in scrum teamwork \r\n- You have an excellent attention to detail \r\n\r\nPlease only apply if you meet all these criteria.

That’s why we encourage a rhythm of heads down, independent work followed by focused constructive debate.\r\n\r\nProduct development teams follow the principles from the Scrum Guide.  We’re practical about process (we use what works), but we’ve found Scrum ceremonies to be a positive framework for transparency and collaboration. To save time, we keep Sprint Plannings to 1 hour and Sprint Reviews to 45 minutes for our two-week sprints.\r\n\r\nSince we are a small team, all engineers (including managers) are on-call for two weeks out of every 8-10 weeks. This builds team cohesion and deepens our understanding of our production system. We are all here to support one another, so if you have personal events during this time we’re happy to swap slots or cover for you.\r\n\r\nWe’re constantly evolving our practices, so please feel free to ask questions and share your thoughts as well!\r\n\r\nWhat’s In It For You\r\n\r\nWe strive to contribute to the well-being of our team beyond Health (of which we pay 85% per employee and 60% for dependents which an increase in contribution in January), Dental and Vision insurance. We offer our team members the following:\r\n\r\nDog friendly office\r\n\r\nLunch everyday plus breakfast essentials like bagel and stocked snacks\r\n\r\nTransit subsidy up to $75/month and up to $50/month for expenses related to health and wellness\r\n\r\nEducation Stipend up to $1400/year for conferences, classes (online or in-person), workshops, and professional certifications related to your role\r\n\r\nLiterature Stipend up to $100/quarter on literature related to your role\r\n\r\nCommunity days where you contribute to your community and enrich both yourself and organizations of your choice.  Each year, you can use up to two days as community days.\r\n\r\nHappy hours and demo days to showcase what you’re working on and AMA’s from the Executive team!\r\n\r\nAbout Fictiv (www.fictiv.com)\r\n\r\nAt Fictiv, we’re inspired every day by our customers and teammates.\r\n\r\nWe support a community that includes some of the most talented people on the planet.  You’ll design for hardware engineers who are literally building the future today (think autonomous vehicles, spaceships, next-gen medical devices) and partner with some of the most skilled manufacturers who produce the seemingly impossible. \r\n\r\nFor decades, these innovators have had to endure long feedback cycles and high upfront costs to bring their products to market.  Our system drastically reduces the time and cost while allowing hardware engineers to experiment faster and with better outcomes.  Come play a critical role in shaping this system into becoming the go-to platform for hardware development.\r\n\r\nWe’re actively seeking potential teammates who can bring diverse perspectives and experience to our culture and company.
